 **DS Sound Hardware**
 The DS contains 16 hardware sound channels.
 The console contains two speakers, arranged left and right of the upper screen, and so, provides stereo sound even without using the headphone socket.

| DS Sound Channels 0..15 |
| --- |

 Each of the 16 sound channels occopies 16 bytes in the I/O region, starting with channel 0 at 4000400h..400040Fh, up to channel 15 at 40004F0h..40004FFh.
 
 **40004x0h - NDS7 - SOUNDxCNT - Sound Channel X Control Register (R/W)**
 
```

| Bit0-6 Volume Mul (0..127=silent..loud)
 Bit7 Not used (always zero)
 Bit8-9 Volume Div (0=Normal, 1=Div2, 2=Div4, 3=Div16)
 Bit10-14 Not used (always zero)
 Bit15 Hold (0=Normal, 1=Hold last sample after one-shot sound)
 Bit16-22 Panning (0..127=left..right) (64=half volume on both speakers)
 Bit23 Not used (always zero)
 Bit24-26 Wave Duty (0..7) ;HIGH=(N+1)*12.5%, LOW=(7-N)*12.5% (PSG only)
 Bit27-28 Repeat Mode (0=Manual, 1=Loop Infinite, 2=One-Shot, 3=Prohibited)
 Bit29-30 Format (0=PCM8, 1=PCM16, 2=IMA-ADPCM, 3=PSG/Noise)
 Bit31 Start/Status (0=Stop, 1=Start/Busy) |
| --- |

All channels support ADPCM/PCM formats, PSG rectangular wave can be used only
on channels 8..13, and white noise only on channels 14..15.

**40004x4h - NDS7 - SOUNDxSAD - Sound Channel X Data Source Register (W)**

```

| Bit0-26 Source Address (must be word aligned, bit0-1 are always zero)
 Bit27-31 Not used |
| --- |

**40004x8h - NDS7 - SOUNDxTMR - Sound Channel X Timer Register (W)**

```

| Bit0-15 Timer Value, Sample frequency, timerval=-(33513982Hz/2)/freq |
| --- |

The PSG Duty Cycles are composed of eight "samples", and so, the frequency for
Rectangular Wave is 1/8th of the selected sample frequency.

For PSG Noise, the noise frequency is equal to the sample frequency.

**40004xAh - NDS7 - SOUNDxPNT - Sound Channel X Loopstart Register (W)**

```

| Bit0-15 Loop Start, Sample loop start position
 (counted in words, ie. N*4 bytes) |
| --- |

**40004xCh - NDS7 - SOUNDxLEN - Sound Channel X Length Register (W)**

The number of samples for N words is 4*N PCM8 samples, 2*N PCM16 samples, or
8*(N-1) ADPCM samples (the first word containing the ADPCM header). The Sound
Length is not used in PSG mode.

```

| Bit0-21 Sound length (counted in words, ie. N*4 bytes)
 Bit22-31 Not used |
| --- |

Minimum length (the sum of PNT+LEN) is 4 words (16 bytes), smaller values (0..3
words) are causing hang-ups (busy bit remains set infinite, but no sound output
occurs).

In One-shot mode, the sound length is the sum of (PNT+LEN).

In Looped mode, the length is (1*PNT+Infinite*LEN), ie. the first part (PNT) is
played once, the second part (LEN) is repeated infinitely.

| DS Sound Control Registers |
| --- |

**4000500h - NDS7 - SOUNDCNT - Sound Control Register (R/W)**

```

| Bit0-6 Master Volume (0..127=silent..loud)
 Bit7 Not used (always zero)
 Bit8-9 Left Output from (0=Left Mixer, 1=Ch1, 2=Ch3, 3=Ch1+Ch3)
 Bit10-11 Right Output from (0=Right Mixer, 1=Ch1, 2=Ch3, 3=Ch1+Ch3)
 Bit12 Output Ch1 to Mixer (0=Yes, 1=No) (both Left/Right)
 Bit13 Output Ch3 to Mixer (0=Yes, 1=No) (both Left/Right)
 Bit14 Not used (always zero)
 Bit15 Master Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
 Bit16-31 Not used (always zero) |
| --- |

**4000504h - NDS7 - SOUNDBIAS - Sound Bias Register (R/W)**

```

| Bit0-9 Sound Bias (0..3FFh, usually 200h)
 Bit10-31 Not used (always zero) |
| --- |

After applying the master volume, the signed left/right audio signals are in
range -200h..+1FFh (with medium level zero), the Bias value is then added to
convert the signed numbers into unsigned values (with medium level 200h).

BIAS output is always enabled, even when Master Enable (SOUNDCNT.15) is off.

The sampling frequency of the mixer is 1.04876 MHz with an amplitude resolution
of 24 bits, but the sampling frequency after mixing with PWM modulation is
32.768 kHz with an amplitude resolution of 10 bits.

| DS Sound Capture |
| --- |

The DS contains 2 built-in sound capture devices that can capture output
waveform data to memory.

Sound capture 0 can capture output from left-mixer or output from channel 0.

Sound capture 1 can capture output from right-mixer or output from channel 2.

**4000508h - NDS7 - SNDCAP0CNT - Sound Capture 0 Control Register (R/W)**

**4000509h - NDS7 - SNDCAP1CNT - Sound Capture 1 Control Register (R/W)**

```

| Bit0 Control of Associated Sound Channels (ANDed with Bit7)
 SNDCAP0CNT: Output Sound Channel 1 (0=As such, 1=Add to Channel 0)
 SNDCAP1CNT: Output Sound Channel 3 (0=As such, 1=Add to Channel 2)
 Caution: Addition mode works only if BOTH Bit0 and Bit7 are set.
 Bit1 Capture Source Selection
 SNDCAP0CNT: Capture 0 Source (0=Left Mixer, 1=Channel 0/Bugged)
 SNDCAP1CNT: Capture 1 Source (0=Right Mixer, 1=Channel 2/Bugged)
 Bit2 Capture Repeat (0=Loop, 1=One-shot)
 Bit3 Capture Format (0=PCM16, 1=PCM8)
 Bit4-6 Not used (always zero)
 Bit7 Capture Start/Status (0=Stop, 1=Start/Busy) |
| --- |

**4000510h - NDS7 - SNDCAP0DAD - Sound Capture 0 Destination Address (R/W)**

**4000518h - NDS7 - SNDCAP1DAD - Sound Capture 1 Destination Address (R/W)**

```

| Bit0-26 Destination address (word aligned, bit0-1 are always zero)
 Bit27-31 Not used (always zero) |
| --- |

Capture start address (also used as re-start address for looped capture).

**4000514h - NDS7 - SNDCAP0LEN - Sound Capture 0 Length (W)**

**400051Ch - NDS7 - SNDCAP1LEN - Sound Capture 1 Length (W)**

```

| Bit0-15 Buffer length (1..FFFFh words) (ie. N*4 bytes)
 Bit16-31 Not used |
| --- |

Minimum length is 1 word (attempts to use 0 words are interpreted as 1 word).

**SOUND1TMR - NDS7 - Sound Channel 1 Timer shared as Capture 0 Timer**

**SOUND3TMR - NDS7 - Sound Channel 3 Timer shared as Capture 1 Timer**

There are no separate capture frequency registers, instead, the sample
frequency of Channel 1/3 is shared for Capture 0/1. These channels are intended
to output the captured data, so it makes sense that both capture and sound
output use the same frequency.

For Capture 0, a=0, b=1, x=0.

For Capture 1, a=2, b=3, x=1.

**Capture Bugs**

The NDS contains two hardware bugs which do occur when capturing data from
ch(a) (SNDCAPxCNT.Bit1=1), if so, either bug occurs depending on whether
ch(a)+ch(b) addition is enabled or disabled (SNDCAPxCNT.Bit0).

```

| 1) Both Negative Bug - SNDCAPxCNT Bit1=1, Bit0=0 (addition disabled)
 Capture data is accidently set to -8000h if ch(a) and ch(b) are both <0.
 Otherwise the correct capture result is returned, ie. plain ch(a) data,
 not being affected by ch(b) (since addition is disabled).
 Workaround: Ensure that ch(a) and/or ch(b) are >=0 (or disabled).
 2) Overflow Bug - SNDCAPxCNT Bit1=1, Bit0=1 (addition enabled)
 In this mode, Capture data isn't clipped to MinMax(-8000h,+7FFFh),
 instead, it is ANDed with FFFFh, so the sign bit is lost if the
 addition result ch(a)+ch(b) is less/greater than -8000h/+7FFFh.
 Workaround: Reduce ch(a)/ch(b) volume or data to avoid overflows. |
| --- |

These bugs occur only for capture (speaker output remains intact), and they
occur only when capturing ch(a) (capturing mixer-output works flawless).

**ch(a)+ch(b) Channel Addition**

The ch(a)+ch(b) addition unit has 2 outputs, with slightly different results:

```

| 1) Addition Result for Capture(x) when using capture source=ch(a):
 Addition is performed always, no matter of SOUNDCNT.Bit12/13.
 And, no matter of ch(a) enable, result is plain ch(b) if ch(a) is disabled.
 Result is 16bit (plus fraction) with overflow error (see Capture Bugs).
 2) Addition Result for Mixer (towards speakers, and capture source=mixer):
 Ch(b) is muted if ch(a) is disabled.
 Ch(b) is muted if ch(b) SOUNDCNT.Bit12/13 is set to "Ch(b) not to mixer".
 Result is 17bit (plus fraction) without overflow error. |
| --- |

Addition mode can be used only if the <corresponding> capture unit is
enabled, ie. if SNDCAPxCNT (Bit0 AND Bit7)=1. If so, addition affects both
mixers (and so, may also affect the <other> capture unit if it reads from
mixer).

```

| ____ _________ ___ ___
 |FIFO|-->|Channel 4|-->|Vol|----------->|Pan|--> Ch4.L

The FIFO isn't used in PSG/Noise modes (supported on channel 8..15).

| DS Sound Notes |
| --- |

**Sound delayed Start/Restart (timing glitch)**

A sound will be started/restarted when changing its start bit from 0 to 1,
however, the sound won't start immediately: PSG/Noise starts after 1 sample,
PCM starts after 3 samples, and ADPCM starts after 11 samples (3 dummy samples
as for PCM, plus 8 dummy samples for the ADPCM header).

**Sound Stop (timing note)**

In one-shot mode, the Busy bit gets cleared automatically at the BEGIN of the
last sample period, nethertheless (despite of the cleared Busy bit) the last
sample is kept output until the END of the last sample period (or, if the Hold
flag is set, then the last sample is kept output infinitely, that is, until
Hold gets cleared, or until the sound gets restarted).

**Hold Flag (appears useless/bugged)**

The Hold flag allows to keep the last sample being output infinitely after the
end of one-shot sounds. This feature is probably intended to allow to play two
continous one-shot sound blocks (without producing any scratch noise upon small
delays between both blocks, which would occur if the output level would drop to
zero).

However, the feature doesn't work as intended. As described above, PCM8/PCM16
sound starts are delayed by 3 samples. With Hold flag set, old output level is
acually kept intact during the 1st sample, but the output level drops to zero
during 2nd-3rd sample, before starting the new sound in 4th sample.

**7bit Volume and Panning Values**

```

| data.vol = data*N/128
 pan.left = data*(128-N)/128
 pan.right = data*N/128
 master.vol = data*N/128/64 |
| --- |

Register settings of 0..126,127 are interpreted as N=0..126,128.

**Max Output Levels**

When configured to max volume (and left-most or right-most panning), each
channel can span the full 10bit output range (-200h..1FFh) on one speaker, as
well as the full 16bit input range (-8000h..7FFFh) on one capture unit.

(It needs 2 channels to span the whole range on BOTH speakers/capture units.)

Together, all sixteen channels could thus reach levels up to -1E00h..21F0h
(with default BIAS=200h) on one speaker, and -80000h..+7FFF0h on one capture
unit. However, to avoid overflows, speaker outputs are clipped to
MinMax(0,3FFh), and capture inputs to MinMax(-8000h..+7FFFh).

**Channel/Mixer Bit-Widths**

```

| Step Bits Min Max
 0 Incoming PCM16 Data 16.0 -8000h +7FFFh
 1 Volume Divider (div 1..16) 16.4 -8000h +7FFFh
 2 Volume Factor (mul N/128) 16.11 -8000h +7FFFh
 3 Panning (mul N/128) 16.18 -8000h +7FFFh
 4 Rounding Down (strip 10bit) 16.8 -8000h +7FFFh
 5 Mixer (add channel 0..15) 20.8 -80000h +7FFF0h
 6 Master Volume (mul N/128/64) 14.21 -2000h +1FF0h
 7 Strip fraction 14.0 -2000h +1FF0h
 8 Add Bias (0..3FFh, def=200h) 15.0 -2000h+0 +1FF0h+3FFh
 9 Clip (min/max 0h..3FFh) 10.0 0 +3FFh |
| --- |

Table shows integer.fractional bits, and min/max values (without fraction).

**Capture Clipping/Rounding**

Incoming ch(a) is NOT clipped, ch(a)+ch(b) may overflow (see Capture Bugs).

Incoming mixer data (20.8bits) is clipped to 16.8bits (MinMax -8000h..7FFFh).

For PCM8 capture format, the 16.8 bits are divided by 100h (=8.16 bits).

If the MSB of the fractional part is set, then data is rounded towards zero.

(Positive values are rounded down, negative values are rounded up.)

The fractional part is then discarded, and plain integer data is captured.

**PSG Sound**

The output volume equals to PCM16 values +7FFFh (HIGH) and -7FFFh (LOW).

PSG sound is always Infinite (the SOUNDxLEN Register, and the SOUNDxCNT Repeat
Mode bits have no effect). The PSG hardware doesn't support sound length,
sweep, or volume envelopes, however, these effects can be produced by software
with little overload (or, more typically, with enormous overload, depending on
the programming language used).

**PSG Wave Duty (channel 8..13 in PSG mode)**

Each duty cycle consists of eight HIGH or LOW samples, so the sound frequency
is 1/8th of the selected sample rate. The duty cycle always starts at the begin
of the LOW period when the sound gets (re-)started.

```

| 0 12.5% "_______-_______-_______-"
 1 25.0% "______--______--______--"
 2 37.5% "_____---_____---_____---"
 3 50.0% "____----____----____----"
 4 62.5% "___-----___-----___-----"
 5 75.0% "__------__------__------"
 6 87.5% "_-------_-------_-------"
 7 0.0% "________________________" |
| --- |

The Wave Duty bits exist and are read/write-able on all channels (although they
are actually used only in PSG mode on channels 8-13).

**PSG Noise (channel 14..15 in PSG mode)**

Noise randomly switches between HIGH and LOW samples, the output levels are
calculated, at the selected sample rate, as such:

```

| X=X SHR 1, IF carry THEN Out=LOW, X=X XOR 6000h ELSE Out=HIGH |
| --- |

The initial value when (re-)starting the sound is X=7FFFh. The formula is more
or less same as "15bit polynomial counter" used on 8bit Gameboy and GBA.

**PCM8 and PCM16**

Signed samples in range -80h..+7Fh (PCM8), or -8000h..+7FFFh (PCM16).

The output volume of PCM8=NNh is equal to PCM16=NN00h.

**IMA-ADPCM Format**

IMA-ADPCM is a Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) variant,
designed by International Multimedia Association (IMA), the format is used,
among others, in IMA-ADPCM compressed Windows .WAV files.

The NDS data consist of a 32bit header, followed by 4bit values (so each byte
contains two values, the first value in the lower 4bits, the second in upper 4
bits). The 32bit header contains initial values:

```

| Bit0-15 Initial PCM16 Value (Pcm16bit = -7FFFh..+7FFF) (not -8000h)
 Bit16-22 Initial Table Index Value (Index = 0..88)
 Bit23-31 Not used (zero) |
| --- |

In theory, the 4bit values are decoded into PCM16 values, as such:

```

| Diff = ((Data4bit AND 7)*2+1)*AdpcmTable[Index]/8 ;see rounding-error
 IF (Data4bit AND 8)=0 THEN Pcm16bit = Max(Pcm16bit+Diff,+7FFFh)
 IF (Data4bit AND 8)=8 THEN Pcm16bit = Min(Pcm16bit-Diff,-7FFFh)
 Index = MinMax (Index+IndexTable[Data4bit AND 7],0,88) |
| --- |

In practice, the first line works like so (with rounding-error):

```

| Diff = AdpcmTable[Index]/8
 IF (data4bit AND 1) THEN Diff = Diff + AdpcmTable[Index]/4
 IF (data4bit AND 2) THEN Diff = Diff + AdpcmTable[Index]/2
 IF (data4bit AND 4) THEN Diff = Diff + AdpcmTable[Index]/1 |
| --- |

And, a note on the second/third lines (with clipping-error):

```

| Max(+7FFFh) leaves -8000h unclipped (can happen if initial PCM16 was -8000h)
 Min(-7FFFh) clips -8000h to -7FFFh (possibly unlike windows .WAV files?) |
| --- |

Whereas, IndexTable[0..7] = -1,-1,-1,-1,2,4,6,8. And AdpcmTable [0..88] =

```

| 0007h,0008h,0009h,000Ah,000Bh,000Ch,000Dh,000Eh,0010h,0011h,0013h,0015h

 00E6h,00FDh,0117h,0133h,0151h,0173h,0198h,01C1h,01EEh,0220h,0256h,0292h

 08E0h,09C3h,0ABDh,0BD0h,0CFFh,0E4Ch,0FBAh,114Ch,1307h,14EEh,1706h,1954h

 5771h,602Fh,69CEh,7462h,7FFFh |
| --- |

The closest way to reproduce the AdpcmTable with 32bit integer maths appears:

```

| X=000776d2h, FOR I=0 TO 88, Table[I]=X SHR 16, X=X+(X/10), NEXT I
 Table[3]=000Ah, Table[4]=000Bh, Table[88]=7FFFh, Table[89..127]=0000h |
| --- |

When using ADPCM and loops, set the loopstart position to the data part, rather
than the header. At the loop end, the SAD value is reloaded to the loop start
location, additionally index and pcm16 values are reloaded to the values that
have originally appeared at that location. Do not change the ADPCM loop start
position during playback.

**Standard NDS Sound Files**

Sound data is often stored in a SDAT file (with SSEQ, SSAR, SBNK, SWAR, STRM
blocks inside of the SDAT files). Samples can be stored in SWAV files (or be
contained in SWAR's inside of SDAT files).

| DS Sound Files - SSEQ (Sound Sequence) |

It is a converted MIDI sequence. Linked to a BANK for instruments.

SSEQ is usually found inside of SDAT files (but also exists as standalone file,
eg. 3DS Circle Pad Pro test/calib, RomFS:\extrapad_bcwav_LZ.bin\*.sseq, and 3DS
Picture Picker, RomFS:\sound\csnd.LZ\*).

NB. For the details of the SSEQ file, please refer to loveemu's sseq2mid

**Description**

A SSEQ can have at maximum 16 tracks, notes in the range of 0..127 (middle C is
60). Each quartet note has a fixed tick length of 48. Tempo in the range of
1..240 BPM (default is 120). The SSEQ will not be played correctly if tempo
higher than 240.

The SEQ player uses ARM7's Timer1 for timing. The ARM7's 4 Timers runs at 33MHz
(approximately 2^25). The SEQ player sets Timer1 reload value to 2728,
prescaler to F/64. So on about every 0.0052 sec (64*2728/33MHz) the SEQ Player
will be notified (1 cycle). As a quartet note has fixed tick value of 48, the
highest tempo that SEQ Player can handle is 240 BPM (60/(0.0052*48)).

During each cycle, the SEQ player adds the tempo value to a variable. Then it
checks if the value exceeds 240. If it does, the SEQ player subtracts 240 from
the variable, and process the SSEQ file. Using this method, the playback is not
very precise but the difference is too small to be noticed.

Take an example with tempo = 160 BPM, the SSEQ file is processed twice in 3
notifications.

```

**Events**

```

| ID Parameter Description
 00h-7Fh Velocity: 1 byte [0..127]
 Duration: Variable Length
 NOTE-ON. Duration is expressed in tick.
 48 for quartet note.
 Usually it is NOT a multiple of 3.
 80h Duration: Variable Length
 REST. It tells the SSEQ-sequencer to wait for
 a certain tick. Usually it is a multiple of 3.
 81h Bank & Program Number:
 Variable Length
 bits[0..7] is the program number,
 bits[8..14] is the bank number.
 Bank change is seldomly found,
 so usually bank 0 is used.
 FEh 2 bytes Indicates which tracks are used.
 Bit0 for track 0, ... Bit15 for track 15.
 If the bit is set, the corresponding track is used.
 Indication begin of multitrack. Must be in the
 beginning of the first track to work. A series
 of event 0x93 follows.
 93h 4 bytes 1st byte is track number [0..15]
 The other 3 bytes are the relative adress of track data.
 Add nDataOffset (usually 0x1C) to find out the absolute address.
 SSEQ is similar to MIDI in that track data are
 stored one after one track. Unlike mod music.
 94h JUMP Address: 3 bytes
 (Add nDataOffset (usually 0x1C) to find out the absolute address.)
 JUMP. A jump must be backward. So that the
 song will loop forever.
 95h CALL Address: 3 bytes
 (Add nDataOffset (usually 0x1C) to find out the absolute address.)
 A0h-BFh See loveemu's sseq2mid for more details.
 Some arithmetic operations / comparions.
 Affect how SSEQ is to be played.

NB. Archived SSEQ files cannot be readily extracted from SSAR file because data
in one SSEQ may 'call' data in other SSEQ.

When extracting single sample block, one can convert them to SWAV files (by
inserting an 18h-byte SWAV header).

The sample blocks are usually (always?) stored at increasing offsets (so one
can determine the size by computing the distance to next offset; or to filesize
for last entry) (alternately, the size can be computed by looking at the Sound
Length entry of sample block).
