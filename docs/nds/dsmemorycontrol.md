| DS Memory Control - Cache and TCM |
| --- |

 TCM and Cache are controlled by the System Control Coprocessor,
 ARM CP15 System Control Coprocessor
 
 The specifications for the NDS9 are:
 
 **Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM)**
 
```

| ITCM 32K, base=00000000h (fixed, not move-able)
 DTCM 16K, base=moveable (default base=27C0000h) |
| --- |

Note: Although ITCM is NOT moveable, the NDS Firmware configures the ITCM size
to 32MB, and so, produces ITCM mirrors at 0..1FFFFFFh. Furthermore, the PU can
be used to lock/unlock memory in that region. That trick allows to move ITCM
anywhere within the lower 32MB of memory.

**Cache**

```

| Data Cache 4KB, Instruction Cache 8KB
 4-way set associative method
 Cache line 8 words (32 bytes)
 Read-allocate method (ie. writes are not allocating cache lines)
 Round-robin and Pseudo-random replacement algorithms selectable
 Cache Lockdown, Instruction Prefetch, Data Preload
 Data write-through and write-back modes selectable |
| --- |

**Protection Unit (PU)**

Recommended/default settings are:

```

| Region Name Address Size Cache WBuf Code Data
 - Background 00000000h 4GB - - - -
 0 I/O and VRAM 04000000h 64MB - - R/W R/W
 1 Main Memory 02000000h 4MB On On R/W R/W
 2 ARM7-dedicated 027C0000h 256KB - - - -
 3 GBA Slot 08000000h 128MB - - - R/W
 4 DTCM 027C0000h 16KB - - - R/W
 5 ITCM 01000000h 32KB - - R/W R/W
 6 BIOS FFFF0000h 32KB On - R R
 7 Shared Work 027FF000h 4KB - - - R/W |
| --- |

Notes: In Nintendo's hardware-debugger, Main Memory is expanded to 8MB (for
that reason, some addresses are at 27NN000h instead 23NN000h) (some of the
extra memory is reserved for the debugger, some can be used for game
development). Region 2 and 7 are not understood? GBA Slot should be max
32MB+64KB, rounded up to 64MB, no idea why it is 128MB? DTCM and ITCM do not
use Cache and Write-Buffer because TCM is fast. Above settings do not allow to
access Shared Memory at 37F8000h? Do not use cache/wbuf for I/O, doing so might
suppress writes, and/or might read outdated values.

The main purpose of the Protection Unit is debugging, a major problem with GBA
programs have been faulty accesses to memory address 00000000h and up (due to
[base+offset] addressing with uninitialized (zero) base values). This problem
has been fixed in the NDS, for the ARM9 processor at least, still there are
various leaks: For example, the 64MB I/O and VRAM area contains only ca. 660KB
valid addresses, and the ARM7 probably doesn't have a Protection Unit at all.
Alltogether, the protection is better than in GBA, but it's still pretty crude
compared with software debugging tools.

Region address/size are unified (same for code and data), however, cachabilty
and access rights are non-unified (and may be separately defined for code and
data).

Note: The NDS7 doesn't have any TCM, Cache, or CP15.

Bit0-6 can be changed by both NDS9 and NDS7, changing these bits affects the
local EXMEM register only, not that of the other CPU.

Bit7-15 can be changed by NDS9 only, changing these bits affects both EXMEM
registers, ie. both NDS9 and NDS7 can read the current NDS9 setting.

Bit14=0 is intended for GBA mode, however, writes to this bit appear to be
ignored?

DS Main Memory Control

**GBA Slot (8000000h-AFFFFFFh)**

The GBA Slot can be mapped to ARM9 or ARM7 via EXMEMCNT.7.

For the selected CPU, memory at 8000000h-9FFFFFFh contains the "GBA ROM"
region, and memory at A000000h-AFFFFFFh contains the "GBA SRAM" region
(repeated every 64Kbytes). If there is no cartridge in GBA Slot, then the
ROM/SRAM regions will contain open-bus values: SRAM region is FFh-filled
(High-Z). And ROM region is filled by increasing 16bit values (Addr/2),
possibly ORed with garbage depending on the selected ROM Access Time:

```

| 6 clks --> returns "Addr/2"
 8 clks --> returns "Addr/2"
 10 clks --> returns "Addr/2 OR FE08h" (or similar garbage)
 18 clks --> returns "FFFFh" (High-Z) |
| --- |

For the deselected CPU, all memory at 8000000h-AFFFFFFh becomes 00h-filled,
this is required for bugged games like Digimon Story: Super Xros Wars (which is
accidently reading deselected GBA SRAM at [main_ram_base+main_ram_addr*4],
whereas it does presumably want to read Main RAM at [main_ram_base+index*4]).

| --- |

The ARM9 WRAM area is 3000000h-3FFFFFFh (16MB range).

The ARM7 WRAM area is 3000000h-37FFFFFh (8MB range).

The allocated 16K or 32K are mirrored everywhere in the above areas.

De-allocation (0K) is a special case: At the ARM9-side, the WRAM area is then
empty (containing undefined data). At the ARM7-side, the WRAM area is then
containing mirrors of the 64KB ARM7-WRAM (the memory at 3800000h and up).

| --- |

**Notes**

In Plain-CPU modes, VRAM can be accessed only by the CPU (and by the Capture
Unit, and by VRAM Display mode). In "Plain <ARM7>-CPU Access" mode, the
VRAM blocks are allocated as Work RAM to the NDS7 CPU.

In BG/OBJ VRAM modes, VRAM can be accessed by the CPU at specified addresses,
and by the display controller.

In Extended Palette and Texture Image/Palette modes, VRAM is not mapped to CPU
address space, and can be accessed only by the display controller (so, to
initialize or change the memory, it should be temporarily switched to Plain-CPU
mode).

All VRAM (and Palette, and OAM) can be written to only in 16bit and 32bit units
(STRH, STR opcodes), 8bit writes are ignored (by STRB opcode). The only
exception is "Plain <ARM7>-CPU Access" mode: The ARM7 CPU can use STRB to
write to VRAM (the reason for this special feature is that, in GBA mode, two
128K VRAM blocks are used to emulate the GBA's 256K Work RAM).

**Other Video RAM**

Aside from the map-able VRAM blocks, there are also some video-related memory
regions at fixed addresses:

```

| 5000000h Engine A Standard BG Palette (512 bytes)
 5000200h Engine A Standard OBJ Palette (512 bytes)
 5000400h Engine B Standard BG Palette (512 bytes)
 5000600h Engine B Standard OBJ Palette (512 bytes)
 7000000h Engine A OAM (1024 bytes)
 7000400h Engine B OAM (1024 bytes) |
| --- |

| DS Memory Control - BIOS |
| --- |

**4000308h - NDS7 - BIOSPROT - Bios-data-read-protection address**

Used to double-protect the first some KBytes of the NDS7 BIOS. The BIOS is
split into two protection regions, one always active, one controlled by the
BIOSPROT register. The overall idea is that only the BIOS can read from itself,
any other attempts to read from that regions return FFh-bytes.

```

| Opcodes at... Can read from Expl.
 0..[BIOSPROT]-1 0..3FFFh Double-protected (when BIOSPROT is set)
 [BIOSPROT]..3FFFh [BIOSPROT]..3FFFh Normal-protected (always active) |
| --- |

The initial BIOSPROT setting on power-up is zero (disabled). Before starting
the cartridge, the BIOS boot code sets the register to 1204h (actually 1205h,
but the mis-aligned low-bit is ignored). Once when initialized, further writes
to the register are ignored.

The double-protected region contains the exception vectors, some bytes of code,
and the cartridge KEY1 encryption seed (about 4KBytes). As far as I know, it is
impossible to unlock the memory once when it is locked, however, with some
trickery, it is possible execute code before it gets locked. Also, the two
THUMB opcodes at 05ECh can be used to read all memory at 0..3FFFh,

```

| 05ECh ldrb r3,[r3,12h] ;requires incoming r3=src-12h
 05EEh pop r2,r4,r6,r7,r15 ;requires dummy values & THUMB retadr on stack |
| --- |

Additionally most BIOS functions (eg. CpuSet), include a software-based
protection which rejects source addresses in the BIOS area (the only exception
is GetCRC16, though it still cannot bypass the BIOSPROT setting).

**Note**

The NDS9 BIOS doesn't include any software or hardware based read protection.

| DS Memory Timings |
| --- |

**System Clock**

```

| Bus clock = 33MHz (33.513982 MHz) (1FF61FEh Hertz)
 NDS7 clock = 33MHz (same as bus clock)
 NDS9 clock = 66MHz (internally twice bus clock; for cache/tcm) |
| --- |

Most timings in this document are specified for 33MHz clock (not for the 66MHz
clock). Respectively, NDS9 timings are counted in "half" cycles.

**Memory Access Times**

Tables below show the different access times for code/data fetches on arm7/arm9
cpus, measured for sequential/nonsequential 32bit/16bit accesses.

```

| NDS7/CODE NDS9/CODE

 - - - - - 11 11 11 - 32 Cache_Miss (BIOS)
 - - - - - 23 23 23 - 16 Cache_Miss (Main RAM) |
| --- |

All timings are counted in 33MHz units (so "half" cycles can occur on NDS9).

Note: 8bit data accesses have same timings than 16bit data.

*** DS Memory Timing Notes ***

The NDS timings are altogether pretty messed up, with different timings for
CODE and DATA fetches, and different timings for NDS7 and NDS9...

**NDS7/CODE**

Timings for this region can be considered as "should be" timings.

**NDS7/DATA**

Quite the same as NDS7/CODE. Except that, nonsequential Main RAM accesses are 1
cycle slower, and more strange, nonsequential GBA Slot accesses are 1 cycle
faster.

**NDS9/CODE**

This is the most messiest timing. An infamous PENALTY of 3 cycles is added to
all nonsequential accesses (except cache, tcm, and main ram). And, all opcode
fetches are forcefully made nonsequential 32bit (the NDS9 simply doesn't
support fast sequential opcode fetches). That applies also for THUMB code (two
16bit opcodes are fetched by a single nonsequential 32bit access) (so the time
per 16bit opcode is one half of the 32bit fetch) (unless a branch causes only
one of the two 16bit opcodes to be executed, then that opcode will have the
full 32bit access time).

**NDS9/DATA**

Allows both sequential and nonsequential access, and both 16bit and 32bit
access, so it's faster than NDS9/CODE. Nethertheless, it's still having the 3
cycle PENALTY on nonsequential accesses. And, similar as NDS7/DATA, it's also
adding 1 cycle to nonsequential Main RAM accesses.

*** More Timing Notes / Lots of unsorted Info ***

**Actual CPU Performance**

The 33MHz NDS7 is running more or less nicely at 33MHz. However, the so-called
"66MHz" NDS9 is having <much> higher waitstates, and it's effective bus
speed is barely about 8..16MHz, the only exception is code/data in cache/tcm,
which is eventually reaching real 66MHz (that, assuming cache HITS, otherwise,
in case of cache MISSES, the cached memory timing might even drop to 1.4MHz or
so?).

*********************

ARM9 opcode fetches are always N32 + 3 waits.

```

| S16 and N16 do not exist (because thumb-double-fetching) (see there).
 S32 becomes N32 (ie. the ARM9 does NOT support fast sequential timing). |
| --- |

That N32 is having same timing as normal N32 access on NDS7, plus 3 waits.

```

| Eg. an ARM9 N32 or S32 to 16bit bus will take: N16 + S16 + 3 waits.
 Eg. an ARM9 N32 or S32 to 32bit bus will take: N32 + 3 waits. |
| --- |

Main Memory is ALWAYS having the nonsequential 3 wait PENALTY (even on ARM7).

*********************

ARM9 Data fetches however are allowed to use sequential timing, as well as raw
16bit accesses (which aren't forcefully expanded to slow 32bit accesses).

Nethertheless, the 3 wait PENALTY is added to any NONSEQUENTIAL accesses.

Only exceptions are cache and tcm which do not have that penalty.

```

| Eg. LDRH on 16bit-data-bus is N16+3waits.
 Eg. LDR on 16bit-data-bus is N16+S16+3waits.
 Eg. LDM on 16bit-data-bus is N16+(n*2-1)*S16+3waits. |
| --- |

Eventually, data fetches can take place parallel with opcode fetches.

```

| That is NOT true for LDM (works only for LDR/LDRB/LDRH).
 That is NOT true for DATA in SAME memory region than CODE.
 That is NOT true for DATA in ITCM (no matter if CODE is in ITCM). |
| --- |

*********************

**NDS9 Busses**

Unlike ARM7, the ARM9 has separate code and data busses, allowing it to perform
code and data fetches simultaneously (provided that both are in different
memory regions).

Normally, opcode execution times are calculated as "(codetime+datatime)", with
the two busses, it can (ideally) be "MAX(codetime,datatime)", so the data
access time may virtually take "NULL" clock cycles.

In practice, DTCM and Data Cache access can take NULL cycles (however, data
access to ITCM can't).

When executing code in cache/itcm, data access to non-cache/tcm won't be any
faster than with only one bus (as it's best, it could subtract 0.5 cycles from
datatime, but, the access must be "aligned" to the bus-clock, so the
"datatime-0.5" will be rounded back to the original "datatime").

When executing code in uncached main ram, and accessing data (elsewhere than in
main memory, cache/tcm), then execution time is typically
"codetime+datatime-2".

**NDS9 Internal Cycles**

Additionally to codetime+datatime, some opcodes include one or more internal
cycles. Compared with ARM7, the behaviour of that internal cycles is slightly
different on ARM9. First of, on the NDS9, the internal cycles are of course
"half" cycles (ie. counted in 66MHz units, not in 33MHz units) (although they
may get rounded to "full" cycles upon next memory access outside tcm/cache).
And, the ARM9 is in some cases "skipping" the internal cycles, that often
depending on whether or not the next opcode is using the result of the current
opcode.

Another big difference is that the ARM9 has lost the fast-multiply feature for
small numbers; in some cases that may result in faster execution, but may also
result in slower execution (one workaround would be to manually replace MUL
opcodes by the new ARM9 halfword multiply opcodes); the slowest case are MUL
opcodes that do update flags (eg. MULS, MLAS, SMULLS, etc. in ARM mode, and all
ALL multiply opcodes in THUMB mode).

**NDS9 Thumb Code**

In thumb mode, the NDS9 is fetching two 16bit opcodes by a single 32bit read.
In case of 32bit bus, this reduces the amount of memory traffic and may result
in faster execution time, of course that works only if the two opcodes are
within a word-aligned region (eg. loops at word-aligned addresses will be
faster than non-aligned loops). However, the double-opcode-fetching is also
done on 16bit bus memory, including for unnecessary fetches, such like opcodes
after branch commands, so the feature may cause heavy slowdowns.

**Main Memory**

Reportedly, the main memory access times would be 5 cycles (nonsequential
read), 4 cycles (nonsequential write), and 1 cycle (sequential read or write).
Plus whatever termination cycles. Plus 3 cycles on nonsequential access to the
last 2-bytes of a 32-byte block.

That's of course all wrong. Reads are much slower than 5 cycles. Not yet tested
if writes are faster. And, I haven't been able to reproduce the 3 cycles on
last 2-bytes effect, actually, it looks more as if that 3 cycles are accidently
added to ALL nonsequential accesses, at ALL main memory addresses, and even to
most OTHER memory regions... which might be the source of the PENALTY which
occurs on VRAM/WRAM/OAM/Palette and I/O accesses.

**DMA**

In some cases DMA main memory read cycles are reportedly performed
simultaneously with DMA write cycles to other memory.

**NDS9**

On the NDS9, all external memory access (and I/O) is delayed to bus clock (or
actually MUCH slower due to the massive waitstates), so the full 66MHz can be
used only internally in the NDS9 CPU core, ie. with cache and TCM.

**Bus Clock**

The exact bus clock is specified as 33.513982 MHz (1FF61FEh Hertz). However, on
my own NDS, measured in relation to the RTC seconds IRQ, it appears more like
1FF6231h, that inaccuary of 1 cycle per 657138 cycles (about one second per
week) on either oscillator, isn't too significant though.

**GBA Slot**

The access time for GBA slot can be configured via EXMEMCNT register.

**VRAM Waitstates**

Additionally, on NDS9, a one cycle wait can be added to VRAM accesses (when the
video controller simultaneously accesses it) (that can be disabled by Forced
Blank, see DISPCNT.Bit7). Moreover, additional VRAM waitstates occur when using
the video capture function.

Note: VRAM being mapped to NDS7 is always free of additional waits.
